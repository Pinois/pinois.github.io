Hey there, it's been a while.

So initialy I wanted to start this blog to share a little bit more about my first work as a Junior Front End Developer, and more specifically my TypeScript learning process.
Unfortunately, I "kinda" forgot about the idea because there's so little time in a developer's life... ;)

But still, I really want to document my future learning process, as it may be usefull to somebody else later on the internet.

Last week, I ran across <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.twrx66kot">this Medium article</a> on 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a> newsletter, which basically challenge you to do 1 hour of coding for 100 days. 
The timing was perfect so why not give it a try.
I already code everyday as my day job, but lately i've been interested about the whole process to create new habits, which can be very powerfull. 
I'm currently reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X">this book</a> about it. 

Also, besides my job, I rarely coded on a side project, which is a shame in some way.
Part of the challenge is to document and share with others the process behind those 100 days of code. <br/>
So it's kinda cool because i'm going to use this blog again yeyyy!

Let's do this bruthas & sistas.
