Hello boys and girls! Now that blog are completely not-cool, I dedided that it was time for me to start one. 
I'm not used to write in English but i'll try to do it as much as I can. You know, for reaching an international audience, and stuff. 

Here I'll talk about random subjects, mostly about web developement and maybe music. We'll see mannnn!
I'll probably begin with some TypeScript posts, because that's the thing I'm learning at the moment. 
I hope it will help some people as much as it will help me learn the subject in a better way. 


Here is some random javascript stuff, just to test the highlighting possibilities : 


{% highlight javascript lineos %}

console.log("omg this code looks so fabulous");

{% endhighlight %}


See you in a bit!
